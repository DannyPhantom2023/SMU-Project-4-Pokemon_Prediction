# SMU-Project-4-Pokemon_Prediction

Project Summary
Welcome to the Pokemon Battle Outcome Predictor project! This project is dedicated to creating a machine learning model that predicts the outcome of battles between Pokemon. Whether you're a seasoned Pokemon trainer or just a fan of the franchise, our project offers an exciting and insightful exploration of the fascinating world of Pokemon battles.

Project Goals
The primary objectives of our Pokemon Battle Outcome Predictor project include:

Battling Insights: To provide trainers and fans with a tool that can predict the outcome of Pokemon battles, taking into account various factors such as Pokemon species, moves, abilities, and stats.

Data-Driven Predictions: To leverage a carefully curated dataset containing comprehensive information about Pokemon, enabling our machine learning model to make informed predictions.

High Accuracy: To achieve high prediction accuracy, ensuring that our predictor becomes a valuable resource for trainers looking to gain a competitive edge.

Community Engagement: To foster collaboration and contributions from the open-source community, creating an evolving and dynamic tool for Pokemon enthusiasts.

Key Features
Predictive Model: We have developed a machine learning model that can predict the outcome of Pokemon battles with a focus on accuracy and reliability.

Comprehensive Dataset: Our project relies on a rich dataset containing detailed information about Pokemon, moves, abilities, and battle statistics.

Data Preprocessing: We employ data preprocessing techniques to clean, transform, and engineer features from the dataset, optimizing our model's input data.

Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score ensures the reliability of our predictions.

Deployment: Practical deployment guidelines and scripts make our model accessible to the wider Pokemon community.
